## Description
- <i><b>Gpio.js</b></i> and <i><b>Gpio.h:</b></i> These files implement a Javascript and a C++ interface for using GPIO connectors on a Dragonboard 410c. I've been using them for quite a while and I haven't run into any errors. <b>N.B.:</b> Both of these files will only work if the board is running Debian. Both of these files also need to be run with root privileges otherwise they will not work.
