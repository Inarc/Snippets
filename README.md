# Miscellaneous but quite useful and handy scripts



## Overview

Quite often I find some short scripts/programs that turn out to be the key snippet of code I need for my work. 
Instead of looking them up every time, I decided to save them here on GitHub so that I can access them from every platform.
In hope that someone else might also find it useful I share it publicly.


### Disclaimer

- I did not write the scripts unless I specified myself as the author in the comments within the script.

- I try to add the source of the scripts, however, some scripts were produced by combining snippets from different sources.

- Most of the scripts are not well tested so careful when using them. (I would also appreciate if you let me know about any bugs :) )
